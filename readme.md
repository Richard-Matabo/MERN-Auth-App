# WORKOUT APPLICATION, FROM TASK 15, LEVEL 3_

This App is an inspiration of what I went through few months after I joined HyperionDev Bootcamps.
After COVID, I lost my working position and I decided from there to start a new carreer in IT. And only few months after, while enjoying my coding courses, everything at my work place came back and I cought myself between busy, hard work, and courses clock that I had to chasse after. And I end up being sick: 'Pernament headache and High Blood Pressure'. That where I came to thing of creating a : 'WORKOUT APPPLICATION' per my personal trainer daily workout exercices.

I Hope I meet the task requirement!
